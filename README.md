PiuPiu
============

Formerly known as [NetworkKit](https://github.com/cuba/NetworkKit), the project was renamed to support CocoaPods.
PiuPiu adds the concept of `Futures` (aka: `Promises`) to iOS. It is intended to make netwoking calls cleaner and simpler and provides the developer with more customizability then any other networking framework.

**Q**: Why should I use this framework?
**A**: Because, you like clean code.

**Q**: Why the stupid name?
**A**: Because "piu piu" is the sound of lazers. And lazers are from the future.

**Q**: What sort of bear is best?
**A**: False! A black bear!

## Updates

### 1.5.0
* Download requests returns `Response` with temporary `URL` instead of `Data`
* Added `localizedDescription` to `StatusCode` which returns Apple's translated error message 
* Re-shuffled "Response" objects 
  * `Response#error` has been removed and replaced with `HTTPResponse#httpError`
  * `SuccessResponse` has been renamed to `HTTPResponse`
  * `ResponseInterface` returns `URLResponse` instead of `HTTPURLResponse`
  * `Response` returns `URLResponse` instead of `HTTPURLResponse` 
  * You need to manually convert a `Response` to an `HTTPResponse` first (see the [example](#making-a-request) below) 
* Errors have been re-organized.
  * `ResponseError` cases have been reduced to 4 and renamed to `HTTPError`
  * `HTTPError` cases contain more generic HTTP errors instead of specific HTTP errors based on status code.
  * `SerializationError` has been moved to `ResponseError` and 2 new cases have been added
* Error handling has been simplified
  * `JSONSerializer` errors no longer are wrapped by another error
  * `Decodable` errors are no longer wrapped


### 1.4.0
* Change `Request` protocol to return a `URLRequest`
* Replace  `Dispatcher` and `NetworkDispatcher` with `RequestSerializer`. 
* Callbacks will only be triggered once.  Once a callback is triggered, its reference is released (nullified).
  * This is to prevent memory leaks.
* Added `DataDispatcher`, `UploadDispatcher`, and `DownloadDispatcher` protocols which use a basic `URLRequest`.
  * Added `URLRequestDispatcher` class which implements all 3 protocols.
  * Added weak callbacks on dispatchers including the `MockURLRequestDispatcher`. You must now have a reference to your dispatcher.
  * Requests are cancelled when the dispatcher is de-allocated.
* Added `cancellation` callback to `ResponseFuture`. 
  * This may be manually triggered using `cancel` or is or is manually triggered when a nil is returned in any `join` (series only), `then` or `replace` or `action` (`init`) callback.
  * This callback does not cancel the actual requests but simply stops any further execution of the `ResponseFuture` after its final `cancellation` and `completion` callback.
* Added a parallel `join` callback that does not pass a response object. This calback is non-escaping.
* Slightly better multi-threading support.
  * by default, `then` is triggered on a background thread.
  * `success`, `response`, `error`, `completion`, and `cancellation` callbacks are always syncronized on the main thread.
* Add progress updates via the `progress` callback.
* Add better request mocking tools via the `MockURLRequestDispatcher`.

### 1.3.0
* Rename `PewPew` to `PiuPiu`
  * To handle this migration, replace all `import PewPew` with `import PiuPiu`
* Fix build for Carthage
* Delete unnecessary files

### 1.2.0
* Make `URLRequestProvider` return an optional URL.  This will safely handle invalid URLs instead of forcing the developer to use a !.
* Add JSON array serialization method to BasicRequest

### 1.1.0
Removed default translations.

### 1.0.1 
Fixed crash when translating caused by renaming the project.

## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate PiuPiu into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "cuba/PiuPiu" ~> 1.4
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `PiuPiu.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Cocoapods

To integrate PiuPiu into your project using Cocoapods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```bash
pod 'PiuPiu', '~> 1.4'
```

## Usage

### 1. Import `PiuPiu` into your file

```swift
import PiuPiu
```

### 2. Instantiate a  Dispatcher

All requests are made through a dispatcher.  There are 3 protocols for dispatchers:
* `DataDispatcher`: Performs standard http requests and returns a `ResponseFuture` that contains a `Response<Data?>` object. Can also be used for uploading data.
* `DownloadDispatcher`: For downloading data.  It returns a `ResponseFuture` that contains only a `Data` object.
* `UploadDispatcher`: For uploading data. Can usually be replaced with a `DataDispatcher`, but offers a few upload specific niceties like better progress updates. 

For convenience, a `URLRequestDispatcher` is provided implementing all 3 protocols.

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    private let dispatcher = URLRequestDispatcher()
    
    // ... 
}
```

You should have a strong reference to this object as it is held on weakly by your callbacks.

### 3. Making a request
Here we have a complete request example, including error handling and decoding.


```swift
let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")!
let request = URLRequest(url: url, method: .get)

dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request)
    .response { response in
        // Here we handle our response as long as nothing was thrown along the way
        // This method is always invoked on the main queue.
        
        // Here we check if we have an HTTP response.
        // Anything we throw in this method will be handled on the `error` callback.
        // If PiuPiu cannot create an http response, the method will throw an error.
        // Unhandled, it will just end up in our `error` callback.
        let httpResponse = try response.makeHTTPResponse()
        
        // We also ensure that our HTTP response is valid (i.e. a 1xx, 2xx or 3xx response)
        if let error = httpResponse.httpError {
            // HTTP errors are not thrown automatically so you get a chance to handle them
            // If we want it to be handled in our `error` callback, we simply just throw it
            throw error
        } else {
            // PiuPiu has a convenience method to decode `Decodable` objects
            self.post = try response.decode(Post.self)

            // now we can present our post
            // ...
        }
    }
    .error { error in
        // Here we handle any errors that were thrown along the way
        // This method is always invoked on the main queue.
        
        // This includes all errors thrown by PiuPiu during the request
        // creation/dispatching process as well as any network failures.
        // It also includes anything we threw in our previous callbacks
        // such as any decoding issues, http errors, etc.
        print(error)
    }
    .completion {
        // The completion callback is guaranteed to be called once
        // for every time the `start` method is triggered on the future
        // regardless of success or error.
        // It will always be the last callback to be triggered.
    }
    .send()
```

**NOTE**: Nothing will happen if you don't call `start()` or `send()`.

## Advanced Usage

### Seperating concerns

Often times we want to seperate our responses into different parts so we can handle them differently. We also want to decode on a background thread so that it doesn't make our UI choppy.  We can do this using the `then` callback. 

Each `then` callback transforms the response and returns a new one.

```swift
let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")!
let request = URLRequest(url: url, method: .get)

dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request)
    .then() { response -> HTTPResponse<Data?> in
        // In this callback we handle common HTTP errors
        
        // Here we check if we have an HTTP response.
        // Anything we throw in this method will be handled on the `error` callback.
        // If PiuPiu cannot create an http response, the method will throw an error.
        // Unhandled, it will just end up in our `error` callback.
        let httpResponse = try response.makeHTTPResponse()
        
        // We also ensure that our HTTP response is valid (i.e. a 1xx, 2xx or 3xx response)
        if let error = httpResponse.httpError {
            // HTTP errors are not thrown automatically so you get a chance to handle them
            // If we want it to be handled in our `error` callback, we simply just throw it
            throw error
        }
        
        // Everything is good, so we just return our HTTP response.
        return httpResponse
    }
    .then(on: DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background)) { httpResponse -> HTTPResponse<Post> in
        // Here we decode the http response into an object using `Decodable`
        // We use the `background` thread because decoding can be somewhat intensive.
        
        // WARNING: Do not use `self` here as
        // this `callback` is being invoked on a `background` queue
        
        // PiuPiu has a convenience method to decode responses containing `Decodable` objects
        // We use `decodeResponse` instead of just `decode`. This will convert
        // HTTPResponse<Data?> into HTTPResponse<Post>
        return try httpResponse.decodedResponse(Post.self)
    }
    .success { response in
        // Here we handle our success as long as nothing was thrown along the way
        // This method is always invoked on the main queue.
        
        // At this point, we know all of our errors are handled
        // and our object is deserialized so we can use it simply like this:
        self.post = response.data

        // now we can present our post
        // ...
    }
    .error { error in
        // Here we handle any errors that were thrown along the way
        // This method is always invoked on the main queue.
        
        // This includes all errors thrown by PiuPiu during the request
        // creation/dispatching process as well as any network failures.
        // It also includes anything we threw in our previous callbacks
        // such as any decoding issues, http errors, etc.
        print(error)
    }
    .completion {
        // The completion callback is guaranteed to be called once
        // for every time the `start` method is triggered on the future
        // regardless of success or error.
        // It will always be the last callback to be triggered.
    }
    .send()
```

**NOTE**: Nothing will happen if you don't call `start()` or `send()`.


### Re-usability

In the above example, we show a number of `then` callbacks to transform our response. In the first `then` callback we deal with common HTTP errors. In the other, we deal with with decoding a specific `Post` object. However none of the code is yet re-usable. 

One way to do that is through chaining.

```swift
/// This method returns an HTTP response containing a decoded `Post` object
func getPost(id: Int) -> ResponseFuture<HTTPResponse<Post>> {
    let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")!
    let request = URLRequest(url: url, method: .get)
    
    return getHTTPResponse(from: request)
        .then(on: DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background)) { httpResponse -> HTTPResponse<Post> in
            // Here we decode the http response into an object using `Decodable`
            // We use the `background` thread because decoding can be somewhat intensive.
            
            // WARNING: Do not use `self` here as
            // this `callback` is being invoked on a `background` queue
            
            // PiuPiu has a convenience method to decode `Decodable` objects
            return try httpResponse.decodedResponse(Post.self)
        }
}

/// This method handles common HTTP errors and returns an HTTP response.
private func getHTTPResponse(from request: URLRequest) -> ResponseFuture<HTTPResponse<Data?>> {
    return dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request)
        .then { response -> HTTPResponse<Data?> in
            // In this callback we handle common HTTP errors
            
            // Here we check if we have an HTTP response.
            // Anything we throw in this method will be handled on the `error` callback.
            // If PiuPiu cannot create an http response, method will throw an error.
            // Unhandled, it will just end up in our `error` callback.
            let httpResponse = try response.makeHTTPResponse()
            
            // We also ensure that our HTTP response is valid (i.e. a 1xx, 2xx or 3xx response)
            // because there is no point deserializing anything unless we have a valid response
            if let error = httpResponse.httpError {
                // HTTP errors are not thrown automatically so you get a chance to handle them
                // If we want it to be handled in our `error` callback, we simply just throw it
                throw error
            }
            
            // Everything is good, so we just return our HTTP response.
            return httpResponse
        }
}
```

To use this we can just simply call `getPost` like so:

```swift
getPost(id: 1)
    .response { response in
        // This method is always invoked on the main queue.
        
        // At this point, we know all of our errors are handled
        // and our object is deserialized
        let post = response.data

        // Do something with our deserialized object ...
        print(post)
        
    }
    .error { error in
        // This method is always invoked on the main queue.
        
        // Handles any errors during the request process,
        // including all request creation errors and anything
        // thrown in the `then` or `success` callbacks.
        if let responseError = error as? ResponseError {
            print(responseError)
        } else if let httpError = error as? HTTPError {
            print(httpError.statusCode.localizedDescription)
        }
    }
    .completion {
        // The completion callback is guaranteed to be called once
        // for every time the `start` method is triggered on the future.
    }
    .send()
```

This concept should not be too new for us since we're probably done similar type of chaining using regular callbacks. Our method `getPost` creates the request and parses a `Post` object. Internally it calls `getHTTPResponse` which dispatches our request and handles `HTTP` errors. 

But we don't need to nest callbacks anymore. It makes our code flatter and easier to follow (once we get used to it).

### Adding extensions to Futures

Another way to handle common logic is to add extensions to futures. 

We can perform our `getHTTPResponse` logic inside an extension such as this:

```swift
extension ResponseFuture where T == Response<Data?> {
    /// This method handles common HTTP errors and returns an HTTP response.
    func validHTTPResponse() -> ResponseFuture<HTTPResponse<Data?>> {
        return then { response -> HTTPResponse<Data?> in
            // In this callback we handle common HTTP errors
            
            // Here we check if we have an HTTP response.
            // Anything we throw in this method will be handled on the `error` callback.
            // If PiuPiu cannot create an http response, method will throw an error.
            // Unhandled, it will just end up in our `error` callback.
            let httpResponse = try response.makeHTTPResponse()
            
            // We also ensure that our HTTP response is valid (i.e. a 1xx, 2xx or 3xx response)
            // because there is no point deserializing anything unless we have a valid response
            if let error = httpResponse.httpError {
                // HTTP errors are not thrown automatically so you get a chance to handle them
                // If we want it to be handled in our `error` callback, we simply just throw it
                throw error
            }
            
            // Everything is good, so we just return our HTTP response.
            return httpResponse
        }
    }
}
```

The only difference in this extension from the original `getHTTPResponse` is that that the `then` callback is added to **all** futures that have the `Response<Data?>` object. This means that this method is more modular as it does not force us to call an arbitrary `getHTTPResponse(from request: URLRequest)` function to use it. This we will see in a moment will allow us to re-use this logic in a more flexible way.

But first let's also add an extension that helps us parse the `Post` object.

```swift
extension ResponseFuture where T == HTTPResponse<Data?> {
    /// This method returns an HTTP response containing a decoded object
    func decodedResponse<D: Decodable>(_ type: D.Type, using decoder: JSONDecoder = JSONDecoder()) -> ResponseFuture<HTTPResponse<D>> {
        return then(on: DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background)) { httpResponse -> HTTPResponse<D> in
            return try httpResponse.decodedResponse(type, using: decoder)
        }
    }
}
```

Here we took a slightly different approach. We changed our method to support **any** `Decodable` object. In other words, this method allows us to convert **any** `ResponseFuture` containing an `HTTPResponse<Data?>` object to one that contains **any** `Decodable` object. 

In addition, we do the decoding on a background thread so it doesn't stall our UI while doing so.

And now, not only can we use these two extensions on our `getPost` call, but we can also use it on other calls such as this `getUser` call such as this one:

```swift
/// This method returns an HTTP response containing a decoded `Post` object
func getPost(id: Int) -> ResponseFuture<HTTPResponse<Post>> {
    let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")!
    let request = URLRequest(url: url, method: .get)
    
    return dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request)
        .validHTTPResponse()
        .decodedResponse(Post.self)
}

/// This method returns an HTTP response containing a decoded `User` object
func getUser(id: Int) -> ResponseFuture<HTTPResponse<User>> {
    let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1")!
    let request = URLRequest(url: url, method: .get)
    
    return dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request)
        .validHTTPResponse()
        .decodedResponse(User.self)
}
```

But these are just some examples. There is an infinite number of combinations you can create. This is why futures are far superior to using simple callbacks.

## Future

You've already seen that a `ResponseFuture` allows you to chain your callbacks, transform the response object and pass it around. But besides the simple examples above, there is so much more you can do to make your code amazingly clean!

Here is an example of some of the built in callbacks available to a `ResponseFuture`. Below you will see a description of what each one does.

```swift
dispatcher.dataFuture(from: {
    let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")!
    return URLRequest(url: url, method: .get)
}).then({ response -> Post in
    // Handles any responses and transforms them to another type
    // This includes negative responses such as 4xx and 5xx

    // The error object is available if we get an
    // undesirable status code such as a 4xx or 5xx
    if let error = response.error {
        // Throwing an error in any callback will trigger the `error` callback.
        // This allows us to pool all the errors in one place.
        throw error
    }
    
    return try response.decode(Post.self)
}).replace({ post -> ResponseFuture<EnrichedPost> in
    // Perform some operation that itself uses a future
    // such as something heavy like markdown parsing.
    // Any callback can be transformed to a future.
    return self.enrich(post: post)
}).join({ enrichedPost -> ResponseFuture<User> in
    // Joins a future with another one returning both results
    return self.fetchUser(forId: post.userId)
}).response({ enrichedPost, user in
    // The final response callback includes all the transformations and
    // Joins we had previously performed.
}).error({ error in
    // Handles any errors throw in any callbacks
}).completion({
    // At the end of all the callbacks, this is triggered once. Error or no error.
}).send()
```

### Callbacks

#### `response` or `success` callback

The `response` callback is triggered when the request is recieved and no errors are thrown in any chained callbacks (such as `then` or `join`).
At the end of the callback sequences, this gives you exactly what your transforms "promised" to return.

```swift
dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request).response({ response in
    // Triggered when a response is recieved and all callbacks succeed.
})
```

**NOTE**:  This method should **ONLY** be called **ONCE**.

#### `error` callback

Think of this as a `catch` on a `do` block. From the moment you trigger `send()`, the error callback is triggered whenever something is thrown during the callback sequence. This includes errors thrown in any other callback.

```swift
dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request).error({ error in
    // Any errors thrown in any other callback will be triggered here.
    // Think of this as the `catch` on a `do` block.
})
```

**NOTE**:  This method should **ONLY** be called **ONCE**.

#### `completion` callback

The completion callback is always triggered at the end after all `ResponseFuture` callbacks once every time `send()` or `start()` is triggered.

```swift
dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request).completion({
    // The completion callback guaranteed to be called once
    // for every time the `send` or `start` method is triggered on the callback.
})
```

**NOTE**:  This method should **ONLY** be called **ONCE**.

#### `then` callback

This callback transforms the `response` type to another type. This operation is done on a background queue so heavy operations won't lock your main queue. 

**WARNING**: You should avoid calling self in this callback . Use it solely for transforming the future.

```swift
dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request).then({ response -> Post in
    // The `then` callback transforms a successful response to another object
    // You can return any object here and this will be reflected on the `success` callback.
    return try response.decode(Post.self)
}).response({ post in
    // Handles any success responses.
    // In this case the object returned in the `then` method.
})
```

#### `replace` callback

This callback transforms the future to another type using another callback.  This allows us to make asyncronous calls inside our callbacks.

```swift
dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request).then({ response -> Post in
    return try response.decode(Post.self)
}).replace({ [weak self] post -> ResponseFuture<EnrichedPost> in
    // Perform some operation operation that itself requires a future
    // such as something heavy like markdown parsing.
    return self?.enrich(post: post)
}).response({ enrichedPost in
    // The final response callback has the enriched post.
})
```

**NOTE**: You can return nil to stop the request process.  Useful when you want a weak self. 

#### `join` callback

This callback transforms the future to another type containing its original results plus the results of the returned callback.
This callback comes with 2 flavors: parallel and series.

##### Series `join`

The series join waits for the first respons and passes it to the callback so you can make requests that depend on that response.

```swift
dispatcher.dataFuture(from: {
    let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")!
    return URLRequest(url: url, method: .get)
}).then({ response in
    // Transform this response so that we can reference it in the join callback.
    return try response.decode(Post.self)
}).join({ [weak self] post -> ResponseFuture<User>? in
    guard let self = self else {
        // We used [weak self] because our dispatcher is referenced on self.
        // Returning nil will cancel execution of this promise
        // and triger the `cancellation` and `completion` callbacks.
        // Do this check to prevent memory leaks.
        return nil
    }

    // Joins a future with another one returning both results.
    // The post is passed so it can be used in the second request.
    // In this case, we take the user ID of the post to construct our URL.
    let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/\(post.userId)")!
    let request = URLRequest(url: url, method: .get)

    return self.dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request).then({ response -> User in
        return try response.decode(User.self)
    })
}).success({ post, user in
    // The final response callback includes both results.
    expectation.fulfill()
}).send()
```

**NOTE**: You can return nil to stop the request process.  Useful when you want a weak self.

##### Parallel `join` callback

This callback does not wait for the original request to complete, and executes right away. It is useful to series calls.

```swift
dispatcher.dataFuture(from: {
    let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")!
    return URLRequest(url: url, method: .get)
}).then({ response in
    return try response.decode([Post].self)
}).join({ () -> ResponseFuture<[User]> in
    // Joins a future with another one returning both results.
    // Since this callback is non-escaping, you don't have to use [weak self]
    let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")!
    let request = URLRequest(url: url, method: .get)

    return self.dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request).then({ response -> [User] in
        return try response.decode([User].self)
    })
}).success({ posts, users in
    // The final response callback includes both results.
    expectation.fulfill()
}).send()
```

**NOTE**: This callback will execute right away (it is non-escaping). `[weak self]` is therefore not necessary.

#### `send` or `start`

This will start the `ResponseFuture`. In other words, the `action` callback will be triggered and the requests will be sent to the server. 

**NOTE**: If this method is not called, nothing will happen (no request will be made).
**NOTE**: This method should **ONLY** be called **AFTER** declaring all of your callbacks (`success`, `failure`, `error`, `then` etc...)

### Creating your own `ResponseFuture`

You can create your own ResponseFuture for a variety of reasons. This can be used on another future's `join` or `replace` callback for some nice chaining.

Here is an example of a response future that does an expesive operation in another thread.

```
return ResponseFuture<UIImage>(action: { future in
    // This is an example of how a future is executed and fulfilled.
    DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async {
        // lets make an expensive operation on a background thread.
        // The success and progress and error callbacks will be synced on the main thread
        // So no need to sync back to the main thread.

        do {
            // Do an expensive operation here ....
            let resizedImage = try image.resize(ratio: 16/9)

            // If possible, we can send smaller progress updates
            // Otherwise it's a good idea to send 1 to indicate this task is all finished.
            // Not sending this won't cause any harm but your progress callback will not be triggered as a result of this future.
            future.update(progress: 1)
            future.succeed(with: resizedImage)
        } catch {
            future.fail(with: error)
        }
    }
})
```

**NOTE** You can also use the `then` callback of an existing future which is performed on a background thread.

## Encoding

PiuPiu has some convenience methods for you to encode objects into JSON and add them to the `BasicRequest` object.

### Encode JSON `String`

```
request.setJSONBody(string: jsonString, encoding: .utf8)
```

### Encode JSON Object

```
let jsonObject: [String: Any?] = [
    "id": "123",
    "name": "Kevin Malone"
]

try request.setJSONBody(jsonObject: jsonObject)
```

### Encode `Encodable`

```
try request.setJSONBody(encodable: myCodable)
```

### Wrap Encoding In a ResponseFuture

It might be beneficial to wrap the Request creation in a ResponseFuture. This will allow you to:
1. Delay the request creation at a later time when submitting the request.
2. Combine any errors thrown while creating the request in the error callback.

```swift
dispatcher.dataFuture(from: {
    let url = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")!
    var request = URLRequest(url: url, method: .post)
    try request.setJSONBody(post)
    return request
}).error({ error in
    // Any error thrown while creating the request will trigger this callback.
}).send()
```

## Decoding

### Unwrapping `Data`

This will unwrap the data object for you or throw a ResponseError if it not there. This is convenent so that you don't have to deal with those pesky optionals. 

```swift
dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request).response({ response in
    let data = try response.unwrapData()

    // do something with data.
    print(data)
}).error({ error in 
    // Triggered when the data object is not there.
}).send()
```

### Decode `String`

```swift
dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request).response({ response in
    let string = try response.decodeString(encoding: .utf8)

    // do something with string.
    print(string)
}).error({ error in
    // Triggered when decoding fails.
}).send()
```

### Decode `Decodable`

```swift
dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request).response({ response in
    let posts = try response.decode([Post].self)

    // do something with the decodable object.
    print(posts)
}).error({ error in
    // Triggered when decoding fails.
}).send()
```

## Transforms

Transforms let you handle custom objects that are not `Encodable` or `Decodable` or if the default `Encodable` or `Decodable` logic on the object does not work for you. 

For example, let's say we want to change how we encode a `TimeZone` so that it encodes or decodes a timezone identifier (example: `America/Montreal`). We can use the included `TimeZoneTransform` object like this:

```swift
struct ExampleModel: Codable {
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case timeZoneId
    }
    
    let timeZone: TimeZone
    
    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        self.timeZone = try container.decode(using: TimeZoneTransform(), forKey: .timeZoneId)
    }
    
    func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        try container.encode(timeZone, forKey: .timeZoneId, using: TimeZoneTransform())
    }
}
```

In the above example, we are passing the `TimeZoneTransform()` to the `decode` and `encode` methods becuse it conforms to both the `EncodingTransform` and `DecodingTransform` protocols. We can use the `EncodingTransform` and  `DecodingTransform` individually if we don't need to conform to both. If we want both, we can also use the `Transform` protocol which encompases both. They are synonymous with `Encodable`, `Decodable` and `Codable`.

### Custom transforms

We can create our own custom transforms by implementing the  `EncodingTransform` or `DecodingTrasform` protocols.

```swift
public protocol EncodingTransform {
    associatedtype ValueSource
    associatedtype JSONDestination: Encodable
    
    func transform(value: Self.ValueSource) throws -> Self.JSONDestination
}

public protocol DecodingTransform {
    associatedtype JSONSource: Decodable
    associatedtype ValueDesitination
    
    func transform(json: Self.JSONSource) throws -> Self.ValueDesitination
}
```

`EncodingTransform` is used when encoding and the `DecodingTransform` is used when decoding. You could also implement both by conforming to the `Transform` protocol. 

There are many use cases for this but the follwing are a few examples:

* Convert old DTO objects to newer objects.
* Different `Encoding` or `Decoding` strategies on the same object
* Filtering arrays

An example of this implementation can be seen on the included `DateTransform`:

```swift
public class DateTransform: Transform {
    public let formatter: DateFormatter
    
    public init(formatter: DateFormatter) {
        self.formatter = formatter
    }
    
    public enum TransformError: Error {
        case invalidDateFormat(expectedFormat: String, received: String)
    }
    
    public func transform(json: String) throws -> Date {
        guard let date = formatter.date(from: json) else {
            throw TransformError.invalidDateFormat(expectedFormat: formatter.dateFormat, received: json)
        }
        
        return date
    }
    
    public func transform(value: Date) throws -> String {
        return formatter.string(from: value)
    }
}
```

### Included Transforms

The following transforms are included:

#### `DateTransform`

Converts a `String` to a `Date` and vice versa using a custom formatter.

#### `TimeZoneTransform`

Converts a time zone identifier (example: `America/Montreal`) to a `TimeZone` and vice versa.

#### `URLTransform`

Converts a URL `String` (example: `https://example.com`) to a `URL` object and vice versa. 

#### `IntFromStringTransform`

Converts a `String` to an `Int64` in both directions.

#### `StringFromIntTransform`

Converts an `Int64` (including `Int`) to a `String` in both directions.

#### `EmptyStringTransform` 

Will convert an empty string (`""`) to a nil.

NOTE: Using `decodeIfPresent` will result in a double optional (i.e. `??`). You can solve this by colescing to a `nil`. For example: 

```swift
self.value = try container.decodeIfPresent(using: EmptyStringTransform(), forKey: .value) ?? nil
```

## Memory Managment

The `ResponseFuture` may have 3 types of strong references: 
1. The system may have a strong reference to the `ResponseFuture` after `send()` is called. This reference is temporary and will be dealocated once the system returns a response. This will never create a circular reference but as the future is held on by the system, it will not be released until **AFTER** a response is recieved or an error is triggered.
2. Any callback that references `self` has a strong reference to `self` unless `[weak self]` is explicitly specified.
3. The developer's own strong reference to the `ResponseFuture`.

### Strong callbacks

When **ONLY**  `1` and `2` applies to your case, a temporary circular reference is created until the future is resolved. You may wish to use `[weak self]` in this case but it is not necessary.

```swift
dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request).then({ response -> [Post] in
    // [weak self] not needed as `self` is not called
    return try response.decode([Post].self)
}).response({ posts in
    // [weak self] not needed but may be added. There is a temporary reference which will hold on to self while the request is being made.
    self.show(posts)
}).send()
```

**WARNING** If you use `[weak self]` do not forcefully unwrap `self` and never forcefully unwrap anything on `self` either. Thats just asking for crashes.

**!! DO NOT DO THIS. !!** Never do this. Not even if you're a programming genius. It's just asking for problems.

```swift
dispatcher.dataFuture(from: request).success({ response in
    // We are foce unwrapping a text field! DO NOT DO THIS!
    let textField = self.textField!

    // If we dealocated textField by the time the 
    // response comes back, a crash will occur
    textField.text = "Success"
}).send()
```

You will have crashes if you force unwrap anything in your callbacks (i.e. usign a `!`).  We suggest you **ALWAYS** avoid force unwrapping anything in your callbacks. 

Always unwrap your objects before using them. This includes any `IBOutlet`s that the system generates. Use a guard, Use an assert. Use anything but a `!`.

## Mock Dispatcher

Testing network calls is always a pain.  That's why we included the `MockURLRequestDispatcher`.  It allows you to simulate network responses without actually making network calls.

Here is an example of its usage:

```swift
private let dispatcher = MockURLRequestDispatcher(delay: 0.5, callback: { request in
    if let id = request.integerValue(atIndex: 1, matching: [.constant("posts"), .wildcard(type: .integer)]) {
        let post = Post(id: id, userId: 123, title: "Some post", body: "Lorem ipsum ...")
        return try Response.makeMockJSONResponse(with: request, encodable: post, statusCode: .ok)
    } else if request.pathMatches(pattern: [.constant("posts")]) {
        let post = Post(id: 123, userId: 123, title: "Some post", body: "Lorem ipsum ...")
        return try Response.makeMockJSONResponse(with: request, encodable: [post], statusCode: .ok)
    } else {
        return try Response.makeMockResponse(with: request, statusCode: .notFound)
    }
})
```

**NOTE**: You should have a strong reference to your dispatcher and a weak reference to `self` in the callback
